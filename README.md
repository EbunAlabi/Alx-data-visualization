## Dataset

> The data consists of information regarding 183,000 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data features include duration (secs) and others such as DateTime, customer type, gender, and some additional variables.

## Summary of Findings

> I was interested in finding out the peak periods, the top users by user time and also the consumer behavior, How long do they ride for and when do they ride the most. I believe that these are useful insights for any business in expanding its marketing efforts or better understanding consumer analystics in general. In general the peak hours are between 7am - 9am and 4pm - 6pm. There are more male customers than female customers and there are more customers than subscribers 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> More men than women ride the bikes, more marketing effort can be carried out to better target the men, and more women can be convinced to start riding bikes too
> The most popular age range seems to be betweem 29 - 34 years old. Suggesting more millenials enjoy our product. I had to extract the age from the member_birth_year column.
> The duration_sec and member_age have no correlation to each other not even slightly, ideally I would have expected some correlation between age and duration, where older folks spend less time riding the bikes
> Suprisingly more customers user the bikses than subscribers.  I would have expected that subscribers would be more active
> Quite interestingly, even though there are way more men than women, women still use the bikes for a more time than men.
